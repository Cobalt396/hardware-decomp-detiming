# hardware-decomp-detiming
Repository for detiming project with UCSB ARCHLab

Project members (for detiming): Joseph Neamati and Sarah Yu

To-Do List:
1. Test rewrite rules on multiple in-line registers
2. Test on more complex circuit examples
3. Test on cases where we do not want to detime (i.e. state machines)
