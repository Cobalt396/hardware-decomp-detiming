# hardware-decomp-detiming
Repository for detiming project with UCSB ARCHLab

Project members (for detiming): Joseph Neamati and Sarah Yu

To-Do List:
1. Test rewrite rules on multiple in-line registers (Done!)
2. Test on more complex circuit examples (Mostly Done!)
3. Come up with mathematical function to calculate "how detimed" a circuit is
4. Translate rewrite rules to Churchroad
5. Test on cases where we do not want to detime (i.e. state machines) (Told not to worry about for now...)
