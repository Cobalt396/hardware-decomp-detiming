# hardware-decomp-detiming
Repository for detiming project with UCSB ARCHLab

Project members (for detiming): Joseph Neamati and Sarah Yu

To-Do List:
1. Test rewrite rules on multiple in-line registers (Done!)
2. Test on more complex circuit examples
3. Translate rewrite rules to Churchroad
4. Test on cases where we do not want to detime (i.e. state machines) (Told not to worry about for now...)
